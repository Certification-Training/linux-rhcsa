# Sharing File Storage with NFS

The Network File System allows the sharing of file between systems over the network. It lets a directory or file systems on one system to be mounted and used remotely on another system. The remote system that makes it shares available for network access is referred to as an NFS server. 

NFS uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and eXternal Data Representation (XDR) mechanism that allows a server and client to communicate with each other.
